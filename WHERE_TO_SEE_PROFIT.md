## 📊 Understanding Your Profit

### **Unrealized Profit/Loss**
- Profit/loss on stocks you **still own**
- Shown in: Home page, Portfolio Dashboard
- Changes with stock price
- Not "real" until you sell

### **Realized Profit/Loss**
- Profit/loss from stocks you **sold**
- Calculate: (Sell Price - Buy Price) × Quantity
- This is "real" money gained/lost
- See in: Transaction History

### **Example**:

**Scenario**:
- Bought 10 shares of AAPL at $150 = $1,500 invested
- Current price: $180
- Current value: $1,800

**Unrealized Profit**: +$300 (+20%)
- You haven't sold yet
- Profit could change

**If You Sell at $180**:
- Realized Profit: +$300
- This is locked in
- Money is yours
